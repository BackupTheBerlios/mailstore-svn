<br>


<big style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction:
</big><br>


<br>


MailStore is a tool that is built in python and provides a mail proxy
for POP3,IMAP4 and SMTP protocols. However, beyond usual proxies, it
makes a backup of all incoming and outgoing email and stores them in a
Maildir format. Emails then can be accessed through an IMAP server run
on the same machine using the backup Maildirs as mailboxes.
<br>


<br>


<big style="font-weight: bold;">The problem:</big><br>


<br>


The idea is to provide a realtime , centralized backup of all incoming
and outgoing of an organization without the need of user intervention,
especially for organizations that use shared email hosting. Many of
this hosting providers allow for only POP3 based access of the email. <br>


<br>


Secondly, due to its shared hosting environment , there is limited
space hence all email ends up being downloaded directly to the client.
Any backup effort has to be taken up by the user on a periodical basis.
This is prone to problems due to the fact that users might either
forget or a data disaster might happen in between a backup cycle.
<br>


<br>


<big style="font-weight: bold;">The solution:</big><br>


<br>


With a backup proxy like this all email is always available at the
backup proxy. Any backup need be done by the administrator only at the
proxy server itself. This we believe to be a much more convenient task
then backing up user systems individually.<br>


<br>


Secondly the MailStore server will always have all the emails the user
has sent or received at any point ,hence the backup will always be
current. To access the email, a local IMAP server can be run that will
provide the user with access to the email that has been backed up. The
user may then add this account to their email client and backup all the
email out of it locally. (E.g. In Outlook you would probably export all
the email in the account). Following that the user will import back the
mail back into its original account. <br>
<br>
Thirdly , the system requires minimal administrator involvement. It
handles the creation of new maildirs for new&nbsp; domain/user
combinations. Hence administrators dont have extra config files to play
with whenevr new users are added to the system. Whether a user exists
or not is left up to the mailserver that mailStore is proxying.<br>


<br>


<big style="font-weight: bold;">Requirements:
</big><br>


<br>


The mailStore system is built in Python. It has been tested with Python
2.3 and 2.4.
Any system which support Python 2.3/ Python 2.4 should be able to run
it.<br>
