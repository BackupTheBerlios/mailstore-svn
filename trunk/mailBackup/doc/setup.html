<big style="font-weight: bold;">Setup procedures:
</big><br>


<br>


There are 2 parts to the server-end setup. Initially you would setup
the mailStore so that all out going/incoming mail is captured. Secondly
you will setup your IMAP server to provide local access to the backed
up emails.<br>


<br>


INFor the IMAP portion, this guide uses Dovecot, however any IMAP
server that uses Maildir format and lets you set the dir where the
maildirs are stored should work. <br>


<br>


NOTE: I would appreciate any information ontheir setup from people who
have set this setup on other IMAP servers so that I can add it to the
documentation.
<br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setup - mailStore:
</span><br>


<br>


1. Untar the mailStore tarball and copy it to where you would like
mailStore to run from. E.g. /usr/local/mailStore
<br>


<br>


2.Enter the dir you just copied it to and edit config.py. This is the
main config file which basically determines the POP/SMTP proxies to be
setup , the root of the maildir folders, and the format of the maildir
folders. The file is self documented.<br>


<br>


3.Start the mailstore by running 'python start_proxies.py &amp;'<br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Setup - Dovecot IMAP:
</span><br>


<br>


In this section we will setup dovecot to access the maildirs that
mailStore uses to copy ingoing and outgoing email. We will also setup
dovecot for a plain / simple style authentication method.
<br>


<br>


1. Install Dovecot as per your distribution/OS. (I install it using
DarwinPorts on my Mac OS X)
<br>


<br>


2.You will then need to configure Dovecot by setting the relevant
values in dovecot.conf.
Firstly set the default_mail_env attribute to the following : <br>


<br>


<small><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">default_mail_env
=maildir:/Users/mohan/Projects/mailStore/mailSpool/%d/%n
</span></small><br>


<br>


to allow the maildir setting we have configured in mailStore to map as
how Dovecot needs it.<br>


<br>


In the "Authentication processes" section ensure the following
settings:
<br>


<br>


<small><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">auth_mechanisms
= plain
</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">


<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">auth_userdb
= passwd-file /path/to/your/passwd</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">


<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">auth_passdb
= passwd-file /path/to/your/passwd</span></small><br>


<br>


The auth-userdb,auth-passdb define the location of a text file that
defines the username and password list of the users accessing Dovecot.
The important thing to remember is that the username that you set in
this file/files should match the directoryname for the maildir format
you choose for mailStore. <br>


<br>


E.g. If the maildirs are being stored in the format
/var/maildir/yahoo.com/test@yahoo.com , the the username should be
test@yahoo.com.
<br>


<br>


For the format of the passwd.imap file please refer to the Dovecot
documentation. (www.dovecot.org)
